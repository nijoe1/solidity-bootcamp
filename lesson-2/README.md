# Homework-2

#### Write a function that will delete items (one at a time) from a dynamic array without leaving gaps in the array. You should assume that the items to be deleted are chosen at random, and try to do this in a gas efficient manner. For example imagine your array has 12 items and you need to delete the items at indexes 8, 2 and 7. The final array will then have items {0,1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11}.
